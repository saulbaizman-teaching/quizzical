          "explanation": "This question does not require mathematical reasoning. Resizing an image in an image editor changes a file's size on disk. Setting the width and height attributes on a webpage only changes the size at which the image appears in the browser. A 5MB image will take the same amount of time to load regardless of the width and height attributes. Therefore, always properly resize imagery!"
