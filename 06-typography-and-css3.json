Yes, it’s weird there’s no property named <code>leading</code>, but that’s the way the CSS cookie crumbles. Also note that there’s no concept of “space after” a paragraph; this is accomplished by adding bottom margin to paragraph elements. See page 283 in <em>HTML & CSS</em> for details."

          "explanation": "It’s an example of a <strong>pseudo-element</strong>. A pseudo-element acts like an extra element is in the code. A pseudo-class, on the other hand, selects elements that are in a specific state. Unfortunately, both are written with a single preceding colon, even though they are different. In newer versions of the CSS specification, pseudo-elements are written with <em>two</em> preceding colons, as in <code>::first-line</code>. (<a href='https://css-tricks.com/to-double-colon-or-not-do-double-colon/' target='_blank'>Here’s a good summary of the one- vs. two-colon situation.</a>) <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Pseudo-classes_and_pseudo-elements' target='_blank'>View the differences between pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes here</a>. See also page 289 in <em>HTML & CSS</em>.<br><br>My favorite pseudo-elements are <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code>, especially when combined with <a href='https://css-tricks.com/css-content/' target='_blank'>the content property</a>."

One can easily go overboard adding transitions to everything on the page, resulting in some sort of annoying, pulsating monster. It’s key to decide where transitions rightfully enrich the user experience and when they are just extraneous noise.” –Dan Cederholm, <em>CSS3 for Web Designers</em>, page 26"

We would have to add a declaration with the <code>color</code> property to change the color, which it would do over the course of 300 milliseconds per the first rule. <br><br>Note that transitions are assigned to the <strong>mouse-off state</strong> rule, not the hover state rule."
